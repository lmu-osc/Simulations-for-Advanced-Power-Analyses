Usually, we would look for meta-analyses - ideally bias-corrected - for more comprehensive evidence.\n\n\nThe R package HSAUR contains open data on 100 depressive patients, where 50 received treatment-as-usual (TAU) and 50 received a new treatment (“Beat the blues”; BtheB). Data was collected in a pre-post-design with several follow-up measurements. For the moment, we focus on the pre-treatment baseline value (bdi.pre) and the first post-treatment value (bdi.2m). We will use that data set as a “pilot study” for our power analysis.\n\n# the data can be found in the HSAUR package, must be installed first\n#install.packages(\"HSAUR\")\n\n# load the data\ndata(\"BtheB\", package = \"HSAUR\")\n\n# get some information about the data set:\n?HSAUR::BtheB\n\nhist(BtheB$bdi.pre)\n\n\n\n\nThe standardized cutoffs for the BDI are:\n\n0–13: minimal depression\n14–19: mild depression\n20–28: moderate depression\n29–63: severe depression.\n\n\ntable(BtheB$bdi.pre >= 14) |> prop.table() |> round(2)\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  0.2   0.8 \n\n\nHence, 80% of participants had at least a “mild depression” before treatment according to these cutoffs.\nReturning to our questions from above:\nWhat BDI values would we expect on average in our sample (before treatment)?\n\n# we take the pre-score here:\nmean(BtheB$bdi.pre)\n\n[1] 23.33\n\n\nThe average BDI score in that sample was 23, corresponding to a “moderate depression”.\n\nWhat variability would we expect in our sample?\n\n\nvar(BtheB$bdi.pre)\n\n[1] 117.5163\n\n\n\nWhat average treatment effect would we expect?\n\n\n# we take the 2 month follow-up measurement, \n# separately for the  \"treatment as usual\" and \n# the \"Beat the blues\" group:\nmean(BtheB$bdi.2m[BtheB$treatment == \"TAU\"], na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 19.46667\n\nmean(BtheB$bdi.2m[BtheB$treatment == \"BtheB\"])\n\n[1] 14.71154\n\n\nHence, the two treatments reduced BDI scores from an average of 23 to 19 (TAU) and 15 (BtheB). Based on that data set, we can conclude that a typical treatment effect is somewhere between a 4 and a 8-point reduction of BDI scores.1\nFor our purpose, we compute the average treatment effect combined for both treatments. The average post-treatment score is:\n\nmean(BtheB$bdi.2m, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n[1] 16.91753\n\n\nSo, the average reduction across both treatments is \\(17-23=6\\)."

We first write the equation for the systematic part (without the error term). This also represents the predicted value:\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{BDI}} = b_0 + b_1*\\text{treatment} \\tag{2}\\]\nWe use the notation \\(\\widehat{\\text{BDI}}\\) (with a hat) to denote the predicted BDI score.\nThe predicted score for the control group then simply is the intercept of the model, as the second term is erased by entering the value “0” for the control group:\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{BDI}} = b_0 + b_1*0 = b_0\\]\nThe predicted score for the treatment group is the value for the control group plus the regression weight:\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{BDI}} = b_0 + b_1*1\\] Hence, the regression weight (aka. “slope parameter”) \\(b_1\\) estimates the mean difference between both groups, which is the treatment effect.\nWith our knowledge from the open BDI data, we insert plausible values for the intercept \\(b_0\\) and the treatment effect \\(b_1\\). We expect a reduction of the depression score, so the treatment effect is assumed to be negative. We take the combined treatment effect of the two pilot treatments. And as power analysis is not rocket science, we generously round the values:\n\\[\\widehat{\\text{BDI}} = 23 - 6*treatment\\]\nHence, the predicted value is \\(23 - 6*0 = 23\\) for the control group, and \\(23 - 6*1 = 17\\) for the treatment group.\nWith the current model, all persons in the control group have the same predicted value (23), as do all persons in the treatment group (17).\nAs a final step, we add the random noise to the model, based on the variance in the pilot data:\n\\[\\text{BDI} = 23 - 6*treatment + e; e \\sim N(0, var=117) \\]\nThat’s our final equation with assumed population parameters!

In the two-group example, this can be expressed as Cohen’s d, which is the mean difference divided by the standard deviation (SD):\n\\[d = \\frac{M_{treat} - M_{control}}{SD} = \\frac{17 - 23}{\\sqrt{117}} = -0.55\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you look up the formula of Cohen’s d, it typically uses the pooled SD from both groups.

    "section": "Smallest effect size of interest (SESOI)",
    "text": "Smallest effect size of interest (SESOI)\nMany methodologists argue that we should not power for the expected effects size, but rather for the smallest effect size of interest. In this case, a non-significant result can be interpreted as “We accept the \\(H_0\\), and even if a real effect existed, it most likely is too small to be relevant”.\nWhat change of BDI scores is perceived as “clinically important”? The hard part is to find a convincing theoretical or empirical argument for the chosen SESOI. In the case of the BDI, luckily someone else did that work.\nThe NICE guidance suggest that a change of >=3 BDI-II points is clinically important.\nHowever, as you can expect, things are more complicated. Button et al. (2015) analyzed data sets where patients have been asked, after a treatment, whether they felt “better”, “the same” or “worse”. With these subjective ratings, they could relate changes in BDI-II scores to perceived improvements. Hence, even when depressive symptoms where measureably reduced in the BDI, patients still might answer “feels the same”, which indicates that the reduction did not surpass a threshold of subjective relevant improvement. For example, the minimal clinical importance depends on the baseline severity: For patients to feel notably better, they need more reduction of BDI-II scores if they start from a higher level of depressive symptoms. Following from this analysis, typical SESOIs are higher than the NICE guidelines, more in the range of -6 BDI points.\nLet’s use the NICE recommendation of -3 BDI points as a lower threshold for our power analysis (anything larger than that will be covered anyway).\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(0xBEEF)\n\n# define all predictor and simulation variables.\niterations <- 1000\nns <- seq(600, 800, by=20)\n\nresult <- data.frame()\n\nfor (n in ns) {\n  treatment <- c(rep(0, n/2), rep(1, n/2))\n  p_values <- rep(NA, iterations)\n\n  # now repeatedly draw samples, analyze, and save p-value of \n  for (i in 1:iterations) {\n    BDI <- 23 - 3*treatment + rnorm(n, mean=0, sd=sqrt(117))\n    res <- lm(BDI ~ treatment)\n    p_values[i] <- summary(res)$coefficients[\"treatment\", \"Pr(>|t|)\"]\n  } \n  \n  result <- rbind(result, data.frame(\n    n = n,\n    power = sum(p_values < .005)/iterations)\n  )\n}\n\n\n\n\n     n power\n1  600 0.728\n2  620 0.738\n3  640 0.756\n4  660 0.781\n5  680 0.791\n6  700 0.791\n7  720 0.827\n8  740 0.820\n9  760 0.852\n10 780 0.866\n11 800 0.871\n\n\nHence, we need around 700 participants to reliably detect this smallest effect size of interest.\nDid you spot the strange pattern in the result? At n=720, the power is 83%, but only 82% with n=740? This is not possible and suggests that this is simply Monte Carlo sampling error - 1000 iterations is not enough to get precise estimates.
